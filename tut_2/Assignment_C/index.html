            <h3>Terminology</h3>
            <p>Male <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit">rabbits</a> 
                are called bucks; females are called does. A term for a young 
                rabbit is bunny, though this term is often applied informally 
                to rabbits generally, especially domestic ones. A group of rabbits 
                is known as a colony or nest. A group of baby rabbits is referred 
                to as a litter and a group of domestic rabbits living together is 
                sometimes called a herd.</p>

            <h3>Taxonomy</h3>
            <p>Rabbits and hares were formerly classified in the order 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent">Rodentia</a> 
                (rodent) until 1912, when they were moved into a new order, 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagomorpha">Lagomorpha</a> 
                (which also includes pikas).

            <h3>Differences from hares</h3>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare">Hares</a> are 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precociality">precocial</a>, 
                born relatively mature and mobile with hair and good vision, while rabbits 
                are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altriciality">altricial</a>, born hairless 
                and blind, and requiring closer care. Hares live a relatively solitary 
                life in a simple nest above the ground, while most rabbits live in social 
                groups in burrows or warrens. Hares are generally larger than rabbits, 
                with ears that are more elongated, and with hind legs that are larger 
                and longer. Hares have not been domesticated, while descendants 
                of the European rabbit are commonly bred as livestock and kept as pets.</p>
