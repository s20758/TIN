            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                Rabbits are small mammals with fluffy, 
                <img class="img-left" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Oryctolagus_cuniculus_Rcdo.jpg/1200px-Oryctolagus_cuniculus_Rcdo.jpg" alt="bunny pic"/>
                short tails, whiskers 
                and distinctive long ears. There are more than 30 species around 
                the world, and while they live in many different environments, 
                they have many things in common.

                Rabbits and hares are in the same taxonomic family, Leporidae, 
                but they are in different genera. There are 11 genera within 
                the family, but the term “true hares” refers only to species 
                in the genus Lepus; all others are rabbits. Also, the American 
                Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) recognizes 49 rabbit breeds.

            <h4>Size</h4>
            <p>
                Some rabbits are about the size of a cat, and some can grow to 
                be as big as a small child. Small rabbits, such as pygmy rabbits, 
                can be as little as 8 inches (20 centimeters) in length and weigh 
                less than a pound. Larger species grow to 20 inches (50 cm) and 
                more than 10 lbs. (4.5 kilograms).
            </p>
            <h4>Diet</h4>
            <p>
                Rabbits are herbivores. This means that they have a plant-based diet 
                <img class="img-right" src="https://wallpapershome.ru/images/pages/pic_v/15979.jpg" alt="rabbit pic">
                and do not eat meat. Their diets include grasses, clover and some
                cruciferous plants, such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts. They are 
                opportunistic feeders and also eat fruits, seeds, roots, buds, and 
                tree bark, according to ADW.

            <h4>Offspring</h4>
            <blockquote>
                They are also more than that!

            <p>
                Rabbits are known for their insatiable reproductive habits for 
                good reason. They breed three to four times each year. This is 
                because only 15 percent of baby rabbits make it to their first 
                birthday, according to the Animal Diversity Web (ADW). So, to 
                ensure that the population grows, rabbits have more babies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each pregnancy produces three to eight babies, called kittens or 
                kits. ("Bunny" is just an affectionate name for a rabbit, young or 
                adult, according to Small Pet Select.) After four to five weeks, a 
                kit can care for itself. In two or three months it is ready to start 
                a family of its own. If there is a lack of natural predators, an 
                area can quickly become overrun with rabbits.
